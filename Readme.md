## yet another blag ##

### wat ###
this is yet another blag. well, not really actually â€“ it's mostly a sample app to try out postgres, sqlalchemy, alembic and flask. it doesn't really a lot, but is a somewhat clean skeleton (i tried!) of how an actual app using this technologies could look.

### run ###
you need [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to run this (but thanks to docker, also nothing else). just go to `_` and run `docker-compose up`. developed and tested this on linux.

### playground ###
postgresql allows storing arbitrary json data in its's tables (in this example, post has a `meta` field, and it can easily be queried again:

```
from yab.models import db
from yab.models import Post

# create a post with metadata
post = Post(title="with meta", body="such metadata, weeeeee", meta={"custom_1": "such value", "custom_2": "many wow" })
db.session.add(a)

# query for that
Post.query.filter(Post.meta["custom_1"].astext == 'such value').all()
```

### blag? ###
yeah, yeah, of course i can't come up with my own [jokes](https://xkcd.com/148/).
