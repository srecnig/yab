## yet another blag ##

### wat ###
this is yet another blag. well, not really actually â€“ it's mostly a sample app to try out postgres, sqlalchemy, alembic and flask. it doesn't really a lot, but is a somewhat clean skeleton (i tried!) of how an actual app using this technologies could look.

### run ###
you need [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to run this (but thanks to docker, also nothing else). just go to `_` and run `docker-compose up`. developed and tested this on linux.

### blag? ###
yeah, yeah, of course i can't come up with my own [jokes](https://xkcd.com/148/).
